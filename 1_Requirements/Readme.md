#REQUIREMENTS

INTRODUCTION: The Electricity Bill calculator project is the application based mini project, which is used to predict the electricity bill of next month by taking input of appliance or load used. The tool used for writing the code in this project is visual studio code. This project has multi file and multiplatform approach (Linux and Windows).

#RESEARCH

People who donâ€™t have technical knowledge of calculating electricity bill can use this application to predict electricity bill of upcoming months, however, the defining features of an electricity bill calculator include:
    ->power rating of all loads
    ->total load calculation
    ->unit consumed per day
    ->units consumed per month

High-end electricity bill calculators generally include:
    ->Electricity bill calculation in urban areas
    ->Electricity bill calculation in rural areas
    ->Bill calculation based on units consumed

Design and testing operations of electricity bill calculator using unit testing algorithm.
